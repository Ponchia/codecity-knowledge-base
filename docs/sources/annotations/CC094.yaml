summary: |
  JSCity’s repository provides implementation-level documentation for generating and viewing JavaScript “software cities”
  in the browser, including the Node.js + MySQL setup, offline generator workflow, and the web UI controls. The code and
  UI also clarify repository-specific interaction details (e.g., hover tooltips, orbital vs first-person navigation) and an
  additional building type for module declarations.

key_contributions:
  - End-to-end operational workflow: MySQL schema, Node server, and offline generator that inserts city data into tables
  - Concrete UI interaction design: orbital vs first-person navigation with adjustable speed and hover-based inspection
  - Documents an extra mapping variant: module declarations (e.g., AMD/Angular patterns) rendered as buildings

terms_introduced:
  - module

implementations_documented: [I018]

quality_notes: |
  The README contains at least one inconsistent/duplicated command line in the “ignore parser errors” section; the actual
  generator code uses Esprima tolerant parsing and records parse problems in tooltips rather than exposing a dedicated
  “ignore errors” flag. Dependency versions in the README reflect an older Node.js ecosystem.
