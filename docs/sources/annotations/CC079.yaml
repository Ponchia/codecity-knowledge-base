summary: |
  Presents “m3triCity 2” (Metricity v2), extending m3triCity with explicit visualization of data sources: data files
  (XML/JSON/CSV) and databases inferred from code. The paper introduces data-specific meshes and metrics, integrates
  database tables via a sky/underground layout, and preserves evolution stability using the history-resistant layout.

key_contributions:
  - Extends the evolution model with data entities (DataFile, Database, Table, TableAccess, Binary) and their histories
  - Adds data-file visualization with domain-specific metrics (entity counts, entity types, nesting, properties)
  - Infers database schema and table accesses from code using SQLInspect (incl. MongoDB support) and renders tables
  - Introduces “City with Clouds” and “City with Underground” layouts to separate databases from source code
  - Demonstrates the approach on SwissCovid Android and GnuCash Android case studies

terms_introduced:
  - data file (city entity)
  - table access
  - SQLInspect
  - city with clouds
  - city with underground

    - "SwissCovid Android case study shows growth of data files and their evolution alongside source code."
    - "GnuCash Android case study highlights database introduction, table evolution, and class–table access links."

quality_notes: |
  Evidence is based on two case studies; no controlled user study or quantitative evaluation is reported. Database
  schema inference is required when schemas are not available in the repository.
