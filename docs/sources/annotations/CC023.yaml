summary: |
  Foundational paper introducing the “software city” metaphor at an OO-friendly granularity:
  packages become districts and classes become buildings, producing a navigable 3D city that
  restores locality and orientation. Defines metric mappings (NOM→height, NOA→footprint) and
  a layout/topology approach (modified treemap / rectangle packing with stacked platforms for
  nested packages). Describes interaction/navigation features (selection, query-based filtering,
  spawning isolated views, color/transparency tagging, vertical vs horizontal navigation) and
  reports the CodeCity tool implementation (Smalltalk on Moose) demonstrated on large systems.

key_contributions:
  - Establishes city metaphor at class/package granularity (realism + scalability)
  - Defines metric mapping approach and discretized mapping strategies (linear vs binned categories)
  - Describes a modified treemap / rectangle-packing layout and stacked-platform topology
  - Documents interaction model (selection, queries, spawning, visual tagging) and constrained navigation
  - Presents the CodeCity tool (Smalltalk + Moose) and scalability observations on large systems

quality_notes: |
  Strong foundational description with concrete mapping/layout/interaction design and multiple
  system visualizations; evaluation is primarily demonstration + scalability discussion rather
  than controlled user study (later papers cover empirical validation).
