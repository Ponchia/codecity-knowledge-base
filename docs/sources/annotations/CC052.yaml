summary: |
  Information and Software Technology (2023) systematic mapping study on visualization approaches for the evolution of Variant-Rich Systems (VRS), reporting 41 approaches and classifying them by analysis scenario, visualization type, and research maturity. It does not contribute software-city/city-metaphor visualization techniques or implementations directly, so it is treated as out of scope for this CodeCity-focused knowledge base.

secondary_study:
  study_type: systematic_mapping
  corpus_size: 234
  included_studies: 41
  key_findings:
    - Feature identification/location is the most common VRS evolution scenario; node-link visualizations dominate.
    - Nearly half of studies are solution proposals, with few proof-of-value evaluations.
  data_availability: not specified in extracted text

quality_notes: |
  While the paper is about software visualization, its focus is VRS evolution rather than software cities; it only references city-metaphor work in related-work citations.
