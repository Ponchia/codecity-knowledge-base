summary: |
  Project page / technical report describing Code2City, a UE4-based 3D software-city visualization for Java systems
  with both desktop first-person and VR modes. It documents the end-to-end pipeline (CodePro AnalytiX → XML →
  tree reconstruction → recursive bin-packing layout → rendering), interaction/search features, and optional code-smell
  highlighting via color.

key_contributions:
  - Details the Code2City pipeline, including extracting Java metrics via an Eclipse plugin (CodePro AnalytiX) and reconstructing a tree for packages/types from XML
  - Describes a recursive bin-packing (rectangle-packing) layout for package/type placement and the concrete metric mappings used (NOM/NOA/LOC + package depth shading)
  - Documents interaction patterns for both desktop and VR modes, including viewfinder/gaze selection, multiple search modes, and VR virtual-keyboard text entry with completion
  - Adds an implementation note on design-problem (“code smell”) highlighting using distinct colors for brain/data/god classes

quality_notes: |
  This is a project web page / technical report rather than a peer-reviewed paper. It references a 2017 conference
  paper (Capece et al., AVR 2017) and points to downloadable binaries and experimental materials/raw data; the
  controlled-experiment writeup and results are covered in CC009.
