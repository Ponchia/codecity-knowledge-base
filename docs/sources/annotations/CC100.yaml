summary: |
  SOFTVIS 2010 paper proposing “evolving software cities”: a city-metaphor visualization where the layout explicitly
  incorporates development history so history becomes visible while the city evolves smoothly and stably over time. The
  approach positions the evolving layout as a platform for integrating diverse product/process data into specialized
  development-history visualizations.

key_contributions:
  - History-aware city layout that makes development history directly visible while evolving smoothly/stably across versions
  - Positions the city as a platform for integrating multiple development-history visualizations (product and process data overlays)
