summary: |
  EASE 2025 paper introducing SecCityVR, a VR code-city environment focused on visualizing SAST (FindSecBugs/SpotBugs) vulnerability findings. Classes become buildings on treemap-laid package platforms; methods are internal floors that are widened and color-coded by severity. Users can toggle call-graph arcs for vulnerable methods, view explanations/mitigations, and collaborate in multi-user VR (Meta Quest). A user study (n=17) compared SecCityVR to a dashboard, reporting higher SUS usability, lower temporal demand/frustration, but longer task times (VR avg +4:06 minutes across the whole task set); a follow-up collaboration study (n=8) found similar workload benefits.

key_contributions:
  - VR code-city overlay for SAST findings, coloring/widening vulnerable method floors
  - On-demand call-graph visualization to contextualize vulnerable methods
  - Differentiation of first-party vs dependency packages via platform color
  - Multi-user VR collaboration for security auditing
  - User studies showing improved usability and lower temporal demand/frustration versus a dashboard baseline despite longer task times

  dependent_variables: [usability (SUS), workload (NASA TLX subscales), task time]
  independent_variables: [tool (dashboard vs SecCityVR)]
  key_findings:
    - SUS median 70 (VR) vs 58.75 (dashboard).
    - TLX temporal demand median 10 (VR) vs 42.5 (dashboard); frustration 17.5 (VR) vs 52.5 (dashboard).
    - Task completion times were longer in VR (about 4 minutes more across tasks).

quality_notes: |
  Source is a preprint-style HTML; figures are referenced but not all visible in text dump. VR study limited to Java projects and FindSecBugs; visualization currently class/method only. Motion-sickness risk noted (fear of heights for some); collaboration study small (n=8) with potential volunteer bias.
