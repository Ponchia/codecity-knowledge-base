summary: |
  Early (2003) research paper proposing a 3D “software city” for reverse-engineered systems and arguing that static/dynamic structure alone is insufficient for maintenance. It overlays production- and cost-related signals (e.g., work distribution, obsolete parts, hot execution spots, frequent modifications) to help stakeholders quickly spot high-cost areas.

key_contributions:
  - Proposes a production-cost-focused overlay on top of a 3D software city to support maintenance planning and early problem detection
  - Enumerates concrete cost/operations indicators (work distribution, recycling/obsolete parts, hot execution, aspects, high modification cost) and corresponding visual encodings

terms_introduced: [software production visualization]

quality_notes: |
  The paper is conceptual/prototype-oriented and does not report a formal evaluation. It describes example encodings and navigation ideas (e.g., fly-through) and notes the prototype was implemented in 3DStudio Max, with OpenGL4Java suggested for future testing.
