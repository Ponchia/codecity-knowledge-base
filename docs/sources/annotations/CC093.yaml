summary: |
  GoCity is a Go-language implementation of the Code City metaphor. The repository README
  specifies the core concept mapping (folders→districts, files→buildings, structs stacked on files)
  and metric encodings (LOC color, NOV footprint, NOM height), and notes a web UI built with
  React and Babylon.js.

key_contributions:
  - Defines GoCity’s city mappings: folders as districts, files as buildings, structs stacked atop files
  - Specifies metric encodings for GoCity (LOC→color, NOV→footprint, NOM→height)
  - Documents the frontend stack (React + Babylon.js) and Go tooling for installation/usage

  Repository snapshot commit: f2b5f40ced5929a8de100a87fec53bac0d296a06.
  The UI source code is hosted on a separate branch (front-end), so this snapshot focuses on
  the main Go codebase and README-provided mappings.
