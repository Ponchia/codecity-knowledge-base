summary: |
  Short CodeCity tool-demo style paper describing the city metaphor (classes as buildings, packages as districts),

  overlaps with the already-processed CodeCity tool-demo and detailed tool paper sources.

key_contributions:
  - None - duplicates CC020 (ICSE 2008 tool demo) and overlaps CC086 (CodeCity tool paper)
