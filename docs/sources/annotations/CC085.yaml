summary: |
  ICPC 2007 paper proposing “software habitability” and locality as key goals for program comprehension in 3D software visualization. It motivates and demonstrates CodeCity: a city-metaphor visualization where packages are districts and classes are buildings, with metrics mapped to height/footprint and package nesting indicated via tile coloration. The paper introduces discretized building archetypes and compares linear vs boxplot-based vs threshold-based mappings, and describes interactive exploration features (context menus, tagging via color/transparency, spawning isolated views, query-based selection, and eliding).

key_contributions:
  - Frames program-comprehension support in terms of habitability and locality, arguing for a “place-like” 3D visualization with orientation points and constrained navigation
  - Specifies the core CodeCity mapping (packages→districts, classes→buildings; NOM→height; NOA→width/length; package nesting indicated via district/tile color saturation)
  - Introduces a small set of building archetypes (house→mansion→apartment block→office building→skyscraper) and discusses three mapping strategies (linear, boxplot-based, threshold-based) and their tradeoffs
  - Describes interactive operations used during exploration: popup context menus, visual marking via color/transparency, spawning district-only views, query-based selection (e.g., subclass hierarchies), and eliding
