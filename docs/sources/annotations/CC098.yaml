summary: |
  Short 2008 technical report summarizing CodeCity as a city-metaphor visualization tool for OO reverse engineering.
  It recaps the class/building and package/district mappings, describes the UI (city + information pane), navigation,
  contextual menus and query types, and highlights configurability via view configurations and scripting. It also reports
  applying CodeCity to 9 systems across Java/C++/Smalltalk (>900 kLOC total) and provides a public download link.

key_contributions:
  - Concise end-to-end description of CodeCity’s UI and interaction model (navigation, contextual menus, queries, selection actions)
  - Documents configurability via view configurations (UI panel) and a basic scripting language for ad-hoc views
  - Provides a multi-system application table (9 systems, >900 kLOC) with package/class counts, reinforcing scalability intent
  - Provides a public CodeCity download URL

quality_notes: |
  This is a short technical report intended as an overview; most details overlap with CC020/CC024/CC086/CC035 and no
  controlled user study is reported here. It is still useful as a compact, citable summary including the multi-system table.
