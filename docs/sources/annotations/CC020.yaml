summary: |
  Short ICSE 2008 tool-demo paper introducing CodeCity, a language-independent interactive 3D visualization tool that
  represents object-oriented systems as a “software city” (classes/buildings, packages/districts). Describes the overview
  value of the city metaphor for spotting large-scale structural patterns, outlines key metric mappings and a rectangle-
  packing-inspired containment layout, and documents the implementation stack (Smalltalk + Moose/FAMIX, iPlasma for
  Java/C++ model extraction, Jun/OpenGL rendering).

key_contributions:
  - Concise motivation for city metaphor: locality/orientation + incremental exploration; avoids low-level “class internals” in the overview
  - Concrete mapping recap: NOA→building footprint, NOM→height, package nesting→district color; discusses alternative mapping mechanisms
  - Describes city overview usage for pattern spotting (e.g., very large buildings as potential god classes) and focused exploration via spawned windows
  - Notes interactive navigation and interaction via query mechanism and manual inspection
  - Documents implementation pipeline and dependencies (Moose/FAMIX model, iPlasma for Java/C++, Jun for OpenGL rendering)

terms_introduced:
  - polymetric view

quality_notes: |
  This is a brief tool-demo paper; detailed algorithmic descriptions and evaluations are in CC023 and CC035.
  The “Tool Availability” link in this paper points to a CodeCity download page (tracked separately as CC017).
  The paper explicitly references “software habitability” (ICPC 2007) and VISSOFT 2007 as prior foundations.
