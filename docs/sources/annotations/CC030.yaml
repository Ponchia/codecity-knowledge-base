summary: |
  Thesis on 3D metaphoric information visualization with a substantial chapter on navigation in metaphoric virtual
  worlds. It introduces “metaphor-aware navigation” (navigation schemes embedded in metaphor components) and
  argues for assisted locomotion and multi-level navigation (e.g., city-metaphor walking vs flying) to preserve spatial
  knowledge and reduce disorientation.

key_contributions:
  - Introduces “metaphor-aware navigation”: navigation schemes tied to metaphor components and hierarchy levels
  - Describes assisted navigation modes (e.g., path-based travel vs jump) and ties city-metaphor navigation levels to route vs survey knowledge

terms_introduced: [metaphor-aware navigation]

features_described: [F026, F064]
implementations_documented: []

quality_notes: |
  General 3D information-visualization work (not specific to software cities), but it provides concrete navigation design
  concepts that can be applied when implementing and evaluating navigation in software-city visualizations.
