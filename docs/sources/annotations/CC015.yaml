summary: |
  Survey of the “city metaphor” in software visualization, framing the metaphor as a
  way to use familiar urban structure to make large codebases navigable and interpretable.
  Compares 14 city-metaphor tools via a feature matrix (Table 1) spanning language support,
  VR/AR usage, building granularity, static metrics, dynamic behavior, and instrumentation.
  Concludes with research questions and opportunities focused on integrating dynamic execution
  behavior, avoiding cognitive overload, and enabling shared/multi-user use.

key_contributions:
  - Comparative table of 14 city metaphor implementations (Table 1)
  - Framing of two research questions centered on dynamic execution behavior integration
  - Research opportunities for dynamic data depiction (entities/citizens, time scales, multi-user, multi-lingual)
  - Explicit caution that “rapidly growing/shrinking buildings” can weaken the city metaphor

research_questions:
  - What fine-grained, dynamic program execution behaviors have been depicted using software cities?
  - Is it possible to integrate both large-scale static and fine-grained dynamic information into the same software city visualization?

terms_introduced:
  - city metaphor
  - churn
  - software city

quality_notes: |
  Re-processed on 2026-01-02 by gpt (an earlier 2025-01-02 pass left missing/incorrect artifacts).
  Excellent survey paper with structured comparison table.
  Focuses on identifying gaps rather than deep technical details.
  Primary source for implementation comparison taxonomy.
  Some implementation details are brief — need original papers for depth.
