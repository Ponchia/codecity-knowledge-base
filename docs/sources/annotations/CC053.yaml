summary: |
  “Original software publication” describing ExplorViz as an open-source research tool (started in 2012) for software
  visualization, comprehension, and collaboration. ExplorViz combines dynamic analysis (live trace visualization of
  communication) with multi-level views (landscape-level overview and application-level city metaphor) and extends to
  immersive VR, including a fully collaborative multi-user VR approach.

key_contributions:
  - Positions ExplorViz as a multi-level visualization tool for large monitored software landscapes (landscape-level + application-level)
  - Describes dynamic analysis focus: live trace visualization of communication to support system/program comprehension
  - Documents collaboration support, including multi-user VR enabling team-based comprehension (including remote sites)
  - Provides tool context: open-source development since 2012, modernization toward modular microservices, and use of Kieker monitoring
  - States open-source licensing under Apache License 2.0 and summarizes research and industry usage context

terms_introduced:
  - software landscape
  - live trace visualization

  study_type: user_study
  sample_size: (not reported in this paper)
  dependent_variables: [efficiency, effectiveness]
  independent_variables: (not reported in this paper)
  key_findings:
    - "The paper states that various empirical experiments resulted in increased efficiency and effectiveness over competing approaches, but does not report study details in this publication."
  effect_size: (not reported)

quality_notes: |
  This is a tool/software-focused publication summarizing ExplorViz’s development history and research impact rather than
  a single primary evaluation. It references multiple prior studies for empirical results and details.
