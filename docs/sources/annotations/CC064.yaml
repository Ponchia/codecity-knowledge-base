summary: |
  Information & Software Technology (2019) controlled experiment assessing the city metaphor on-screen vs in immersive
  VR (Code2City vs Code2CityVR) and comparing both against Eclipse augmented with a “Metrics & Smells” plugin.
  Across 42 participants in the experimental sessions, both city-metaphor tools significantly improved correctness vs
  Eclipse, and the VR condition was significantly faster than the on-screen city while inducing common VR side effects.

key_contributions:
  - Controlled experiment (between-subjects; 42 participants in experimental sessions) comparing Eclipse vs Code2City vs Code2CityVR on program-comprehension tasks
  - Reports significant correctness improvements for both city-metaphor treatments over Eclipse and significant time reductions for VR over both other treatments
  - Documents tool support for the tasks, including viewfinder/gaze selection, name/caller search, and smell highlighting (brain/data/god classes) consistent across treatments
  - Includes PANAS and post-questionnaire results and reports common VR side effects (headache, nausea, visual annoyance)

  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 42
  dependent_variables: [score (correctness), task completion time, positive affect score (PAS), negative affect score (NAS), post-questionnaire responses]
  independent_variables: [tool (Eclipse vs Code2City vs Code2CityVR)]
  key_findings:
    - "Correctness (Score) differs significantly by tool (ANOVA p=0.005); both Code2City and Code2CityVR outperform Eclipse (Tukey HSD p=0.006 and p=0.035)."
    - "Completion time differs significantly by tool (ANOVA p<0.001); Code2CityVR is faster than Code2City (p=0.001) and Eclipse (p<0.001)."
    - "Mean Score: Eclipse 4.754 vs Code2City 6.183 vs Code2CityVR 5.788 (max=8). Mean Time (minutes): Eclipse 43.385 vs Code2City 38.167 vs Code2CityVR 27.294."
    - "Only 3/17 Code2CityVR participants reported no side effects; headache, nausea, and visual annoyance were common."
