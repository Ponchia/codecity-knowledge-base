summary: |
  Marketing/overview site for CodeCharta that explains the city metaphor (files as buildings, folders as districts) and
  positions the tool for hotspot detection, change tracking, and communication of technical debt. It highlights 3D model
  export for presentations, integration with other analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube), and a local-only processing posture.

key_contributions:
  - Confirms CodeCharta’s file-as-building and folder-as-district mapping in a concise public description
  - Frames core user goals: hotspot detection and change tracking over time
  - Emphasizes that processing/visualization stays local unless explicitly shared

terms_introduced:
  - code hotspot

quality_notes: |
  This page is high-level and promotional; it does not specify algorithms or data formats beyond the city metaphor and
  feature claims. Treat it as corroborating evidence rather than a primary technical reference.
