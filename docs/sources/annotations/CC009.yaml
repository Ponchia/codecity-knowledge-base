summary: |
  Empirical study evaluating the city metaphor in two implementations: a desktop 3D tool (Code2City) and an immersive
  VR tool (Code2CityVR, Oculus Rift). Compares both against Eclipse for program comprehension tasks, focusing on users’
  feelings/emotions (PANAS) and post-task thinking (tool quality, usefulness, playfulness, etc.), and reports VR side effects.

key_contributions:
  - Describes Code2City and Code2CityVR interaction models (viewfinder vs gaze/controller selection; VR navigation and search input)
  - Reports a controlled experiment on affect and thinking comparing Code2City, Code2CityVR, and Eclipse (between-subject)
  - Finds significantly higher positive affect for Code2CityVR vs Eclipse, with no significant differences in negative affect
  - Reports largely positive and comparable “thinking” across tools, with a positive effect for city-metaphor tools on playfulness
  - Highlights VR side effects (headache, nausea, visual annoyance) experienced by most participants

terms_introduced:
  - PANAS
  - positive affect score (PAS)
  - negative affect score (NAS)

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 42 students (between-subject; 12 Code2City, 17 Code2CityVR, 13 Eclipse)
  dependent_variables:
    - positive affect score (PAS)
    - negative affect score (NAS)
    - post-mortem survey theme scores (TQ, IQ, SQ, P, PEU, PU, AU, BIU)
    - self-reported VR side effects
  independent_variables:
    - tool (Code2City vs Code2CityVR vs Eclipse)
  key_findings:
    - "Positive affect (PAS): significant overall difference (ANOVA p=0.04); Code2CityVR > Eclipse (Tukey p=0.031). Mean PAS: Code2CityVR 31.412, Code2City 28.167, Eclipse 24.231."
    - "Negative affect (NAS): no significant differences (Kruskal p=0.164). Mean NAS: Code2City 11.667, Code2CityVR 13.235, Eclipse 13.538 (lower is better)."
    - "Thinking (post-mortem themes): most overall theme differences are not significant; playfulness differs (Kruskal p=0.024) with Code2City > Eclipse (post-hoc p=0.011). Mean playfulness: Code2City 32.417, Code2CityVR 30.706, Eclipse 25.308."
    - "VR side effects: only 3/17 Code2CityVR participants reported no side effect; most reported headache, nausea, or visual annoyance."
  effect_size: (not reported)

quality_notes: |
  Strong for affect/thinking-focused evaluation of VR vs desktop vs IDE baseline, with explicit threats-to-validity discussion.
  Uses student participants; generalizability to professional developers is discussed as a validity threat. Reports that VR can
  introduce physical discomforts, suggesting caution and the need for further studies.
  CC009 also references a companion paper by Romano et al. (“[26]”) for the quantitative part of the larger study and points
  to another publication (“[5]”) for additional implementation details about Code2City/Code2CityVR; these are not currently
  indexed as separate CC### sources in this repo.
