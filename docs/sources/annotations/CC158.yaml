  Introduces Chart Reader, an accessibility engine for screen reader users.
  Combines hierarchical navigation, sonification, and cross-cutting insights
  to enable blind/low-vision users to consume data visualizations autonomously.
key_contributions:
  - Hierarchical navigation structure for accessible chart reading
  - Sonification for non-visual data consumption
  - Five-region navigation model (insights, x-axis, y-axis, data points, filters)
  - Design dimensions: structure, navigation, description, non-speech audio, focus
terms_introduced:
  - sonification: "Converting data values into non-speech audio tones for non-visual consumption"
  - hierarchical accessibility: "Organizing visualization elements into navigable hierarchy for screen readers"
features_described:
  - F078  # accessibility-mode (NEW)
  - F079  # sonification-navigation (NEW)
implementations_documented: []
empirical_evidence:
  study_type: user_study
  sample_size: 10
  dependent_variables: [task_completion, autonomy, comprehension]
  independent_variables: [navigation_method, sonification]
  key_findings:
    - "BLV screen reader users can autonomously read and understand visualizations"
    - "Five-region model supports targeted data comparison"
