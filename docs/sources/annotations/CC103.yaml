summary: |
  2015 paper that integrates CodeMetropolis into the Eclipse IDE via a plug-in and a Minecraft
  mod, enabling IDE-driven builds and synchronized navigation. It describes the toolchain
  (Eclipse + SourceMeter + CodeMetropolis + Minecraft), manual and automatic navigation (jump
  and follow), and configurable mapping files for metric-to-visual encodings. The paper presents
  use cases and demo scenarios showing how floor height and materials map to metrics.

key_contributions:
  - Integrates CodeMetropolis with Eclipse, enabling background analysis and in-IDE launch
  - Introduces jump and follow navigation to sync the active file with the city view
  - Documents mapping files for configuring metric-to-visual encodings (height/material)
  - Describes the multi-component toolchain (Eclipse plug-in, SourceMeter, Minecraft mod)
  - Provides exploration/education use cases and demo scenarios

quality_notes: |
  The paper focuses on integration and scenarios rather than formal evaluation. Navigation is
  one-way (IDE -> city) in the current version; two-way synchronization and auto-rebuild are
  listed as future work. A GitHub release for the plug-in/mod is provided in the supplement.
