summary: |
  MuC 2019 demonstration paper presenting IslandViz, a VR visualization for OSGi-based software architectures.
  It describes an island metaphor (modules as islands) rendered on a virtual table, enabling interactive exploration
  of modules and their dependencies.

key_contributions:
  - Demonstration of IslandViz for VR software-architecture exploration using an island metaphor
  - Describes a virtual-table (“world-in-miniature”) setup for interacting with the island system and examining dependencies
