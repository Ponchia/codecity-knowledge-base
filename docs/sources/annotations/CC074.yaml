summary: |
  DLR project page describing IslandViz as an island-metaphor visualization of modularized software systems,
  emphasizing dependencies (imports/exports) between modules. It positions IslandViz as a VR/AR application
  usable with VR headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift / HTC Vive) and also mentions a web-based 2D variant.

key_contributions:
  - Confirms IslandViz supported modalities (VR via Oculus Rift/HTC Vive + AR) and a listed web-based 2D variant
  - High-level description of the island metaphor (modules as islands with packages/classes) and dependency display
  - Describes intended audiences/use cases (developers, project managers, onboarding and stakeholder communication)
