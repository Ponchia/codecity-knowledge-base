summary: |
  TypeScript/ES2015 library for building “code city” visualizations with configurable layout and packing strategies.
  It implements both a district-based CodeCity-style layout and an EvoStreet-style street layout, and documents an
  evolution-aware model representation for consistent software cities. The repository is used as a layout engine by
  SoftVis3D.

key_contributions:
  - Reusable code-city layout/geometry library (TypeScript) used by SoftVis3D
  - Documents an evolution-model representation as a 5-tuple (G, T, R, fe, A) suitable for consistent city layouts across versions
  - Implements District and Evostreet illustrators with configurable containers and placement options (e.g., strip-treemap/grid and lightmap packing)
