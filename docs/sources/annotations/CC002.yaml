summary: |
  Galois blog post motivating “code as city” visualizations as a shared spatial metaphor to help engineers orient in
  large codebases and communicate about architecture. It sketches (at a high level) how dependencies and other
  analysis results could be layered onto a cityscape, and notes an early prototype implemented in Blender with a
  planned VSCode integration.

key_contributions:
  - Modern industry framing of software cities as shared metaphors for onboarding and team communication
  - Suggests layering analysis results (e.g., dependencies) on top of a cityscape as an overlay metaphor (e.g., transit map)
  - Notes an early prototype tool (Blender) and intent to develop an IDE (VSCode) plugin
