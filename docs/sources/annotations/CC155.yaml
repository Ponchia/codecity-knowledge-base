summary: |
  Presents a hybrid system combining deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided
  visual exploration for large-scale codebase understanding. Proposes intent-aware
  navigation, contextual grounding, and interactive adaptation techniques.
key_contributions:
  - First documented integration of LLM-guided navigation with structural visualization
  - Intent-aware exploration that interprets developer queries to guide navigation
  - Contextual grounding combining AI capabilities with deterministic structural views
terms_introduced:
  - intent-aware navigation: "LLM interprets developer queries to guide exploration paths"
  - contextual grounding: "Combining AI capabilities with deterministic structural views"
features_described:
  - F075  # llm-guided-navigation (NEW)
implementations_documented: []
quality_notes: |
  arXiv preprint (2025), Java prototype. Future work includes empirical evaluation.
  Directly applicable to software city visualization as enhancement to navigation.
