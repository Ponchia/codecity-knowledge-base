summary: |
  Modern CodeMetropolis repository implementing a multi-stage Java toolchain (converter → mapping → placing → rendering)
  that generates Minecraft worlds from static-analysis inputs (notably SourceMeter; also SonarQube). The repo provides
  mapping XML examples (normalization/quantization conversions) and extends Minecraft-based cities with gamified
  encodings such as a `danger` attribute that renders floors/cellars with mob spawners and loot chests.

key_contributions:
  - Documents a modular Java toolchain pipeline with CLI usage strings for converter/mapping/placing/rendering
  - Provides mapping XML examples (v1/v2) with conversions (normalize, quantization) for metric-to-visual bindings
  - Includes a placing stage implementing a recursive rectangle-packing (“PackLayout”) layout with spacing
  - Adds a gamified “danger” encoding: danger-tagged floors/cellars render with mob spawners and chests
  - Adds a GUI wrapper that runs the full pipeline and stores intermediate files under `.code-metropolis/<timestamp>`
