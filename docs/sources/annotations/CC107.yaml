summary: |
  Short VRST 2017 paper proposing a VR environment for searching and exploring software repositories. The abstract
  describes mapping repository information structures to interactive 3D objects and hypothesizes that VR exploration can
  help users acquire problem-domain knowledge “subliminally” during exploration to perform future tasks more effectively.

key_contributions:
  - Proposes VR-based search and exploration of software repositories via mapping information structures to interactive 3D objects
  - Suggests VR exploration can support problem-domain knowledge acquisition during navigation

quality_notes: |
  The local artifact is an ACM Digital Library landing page / abstract (Wayback mirror) without accessible full text.
  The abstract does not explicitly describe a software-city metaphor or provide enough technical detail to extract new
  features beyond a high-level “VR repository exploration” framing.
