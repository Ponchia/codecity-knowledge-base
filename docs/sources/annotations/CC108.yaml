summary: |
  VISSOFT 2013 preprint introducing the ExplorViz approach for live trace visualization of large software landscapes.
  It outlines a five-step pipeline (monitoring, preprocessing with trace reduction, aggregation, transformation, navigation)
  and presents a two-perspective UI: a 2D landscape-level view (UML-deployment/activity inspired) and a 3D system-level
  city view per application. Scalability is addressed via on-demand exploration, including aggregating similar entities and
  expanding relationships when requested.

key_contributions:
  - Early end-to-end description of ExplorViz for live monitoring traces in large software landscapes (pipeline A1–A5)
  - Defines the dual-perspective visualization (2D landscape view + 3D city per system) and linking between levels
  - Details scalability strategy using trace reduction and on-demand expansion of aggregated entities/relations

quality_notes: |
  This is a preprint with concept descriptions and mockups; it does not report a controlled evaluation. Some technical
  details overlap with later ExplorViz sources (CC053/CC080/CC071), but CC108 is useful for provenance of the original
  trace-processing pipeline and landscape/system dual-view design.
