summary: |
  PhD thesis presenting the most complete “software systems as cities” treatment in this corpus:
  defines the city metaphor with explicit concept/property mapping, details the rectangle-packing
  layout and method-level representations (bricks/progressive bricks), and extends the metaphor
  to evolution analysis (age map, time travel, timeline) and design-quality assessment (disharmony
  maps driven by detection strategies). Documents the CodeCity tool architecture and interaction
  model (view configurations, scripting, selection/querying/spawning/tagging/navigation), and
  includes both usability feedback and a controlled experiment evaluating effectiveness.

key_contributions:
  - Canonical end-to-end description of software cities across structure, evolution, and design quality
  - Detailed algorithms for layout (rectangle packing) and fine-grained method visualization (bricks/progressive bricks)
  - Evolution techniques: age map, time travel with temporal stability, and timeline visualizations (Hismo-based)
  - Design-quality overlays via disharmony maps integrating detection-strategy results into the city
  - Tooling design: view configurations (glyph/layout/mapper specs), scripting for prototyping, and rich interaction model
  - Empirical evidence: controlled experiment and usability feedback on CodeCity

quality_notes: |
  Strongest single source for the CodeCity approach and its extensions (evolution + design quality),
  plus tooling and evaluation context. Empirical results include a controlled experiment (Chapter 8)
  comparing CodeCity to an IDE+spreadsheet baseline, and a small usability questionnaire.
