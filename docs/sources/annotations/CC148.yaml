summary: |
  Medium post presenting Viseagull, an open-source “ludic design” repository-exploration tool that visualizes files as
  buildings clustered into “cities” based on logical coupling (co-change) or semantic coupling (lexical similarity), and
  links clusters with roads based on shared-commit activity. It describes the underlying coupling computations (Jaccard
  distance for co-change; tf-idf + cosine similarity for lexicon), the layout approach (t-SNE + spring-like overlap
  removal), and interactive controls (hover, zoom/scroll, road-thresholding, commit highlighting, date-based coloring).

key_contributions:
  - Defines and applies logical coupling (co-change) and semantic coupling (lexicon similarity) to cluster files
  - Describes a coupling-driven layout using t-SNE positions plus a spring-layout-like overlap-avoidance step
  - Documents an interactive “cities + roads” visualization of coupling relationships and history-derived signals

terms_introduced:
  - logical coupling
  - semantic coupling
