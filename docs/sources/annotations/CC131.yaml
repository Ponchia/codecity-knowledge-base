summary: |
  Getaviz is an open-source research platform for generating and exploring software visualizations in 2D, 3D, and VR,
  including multiple city-metaphor variants (“City”, “City Floors”, “City Bricks”). It supports multiple languages
  (Java, Ruby, PHP, C#) and can enrich structural views with behavioral (dynamic) and evolutionary information (git/svn),
  aiming at tasks like antipattern refactoring, runtime bottleneck localization, software quality assessment, and
  multi-version change tracking.

key_contributions:
  - Multi-view visualization platform spanning browser-based 3D and VR (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift)
  - City-metaphor variants that explicitly expose method-level detail (floors and bricks)
  - Generator pipeline consumes structural (FAMIX) and optionally dynamic and/or Hismo models
  - Multi-language support via extractors (Java, Ruby, PHP, C#)
  - Open-source distribution with Docker images for major components (generator2, UI, evaluation server)

quality_notes: |
  Repo snapshot at commit 4df62116f1932e4dd6ce7f2b9cd693cda026c5d9 (2023-02-09). The legacy `generator` component is
  marked deprecated in favor of `generator2`. The UI documentation mentions X3DOM, while bundled example outputs in
  `ui/data/*/model/model.html` use A-Frame HTML scenes plus `metaData.json` keyed by FAMIX IDs.
