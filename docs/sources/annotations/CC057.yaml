summary: |
  Early paper on “Imsovision”, a VRML-based immersive software-visualization environment targeting the CAVE. It argues
  that immersive VR (stereopsis + motion + in-world interaction) can aid comprehension compared to 2D/3D desktop views,
  and outlines collaboration goals via “Multiple Collaborative Representations” (MCR), where collaborators can create
  and tailor their own views rather than only sharing a single representation.

key_contributions:
  - Motivates immersive VR for software visualization and distinguishes VR environments from conventional 3D desktop views (stereopsis, physical navigation, in-context access to external info)
  - Describes Imsovision’s implementation approach (VRML visualizations rendered in the CAVE with wand/joystick interaction)
  - Frames software-visualization tasks using Shneiderman’s overview/zoom/filter/details/relate/history/extract task set and extends it for collaboration
  - Introduces MCR as a collaboration paradigm for software visualization, emphasizing per-user tailorable representations

    - "Demonstrates a VR visualization of a small UML-modeled mail system and argues it conveys more metric/structure detail than the corresponding UML diagram."
  effect_size: not reported

quality_notes: |
  The paper is primarily conceptual and formative; no controlled user study is reported. Collaboration is discussed as a
  design direction (MCR) rather than a validated implementation outcome.
