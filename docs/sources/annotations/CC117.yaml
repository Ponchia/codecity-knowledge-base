summary: |
  SoftVis 2008 paper introducing “disharmony maps”, which overlay code-city visualizations with the results of
  metric-based detection strategies to localize design disharmonies (code smells) in the context of the full system.
  Disharmony types are encoded primarily via vivid colors while structural metrics remain mapped to geometry, enabling
  quick assessment of distribution, proportion, and correlations of design problems across packages. The authors apply
  the approach to four open-source Java systems and report qualitative findings.

key_contributions:
  - Introduces disharmony maps: color-encoded overlays of detection-strategy results on top of a software city
  - Frames disharmony maps as an answer to the “where are the design problems?” question, preserving global context unlike lists
  - Reports application to 4 open-source Java systems (incl. JDK) to illustrate distribution and correlation of disharmony types

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: case_study
  sample_size: 4 systems (open-source Java)
  dependent_variables: [qualitative findings about disharmony distribution and dominant types]
  independent_variables: []
  key_findings:
    - Disharmony maps help localize disharmonies in package context and distinguish large-but-healthy from disharmonious entities.
    - Encoding disharmony types with color preserves the ability to map structural metrics on geometry for additional context.
  effect_size: not reported

quality_notes: |
  This paper focuses on introducing the visualization concept and demonstrating it on real systems; it does not provide
  a controlled user study. CC035 later expands the approach and CC086 provides a disease-map motivation for vivid/neutral color schemes.
