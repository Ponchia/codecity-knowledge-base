summary: |
  GitHub organization page for ExplorViz with a short README-style description and links to repositories (frontend,
  deployment, collaboration-service, span-service, etc.). The description overlaps existing ExplorViz sources and does
  not add technical detail beyond the already-processed ExplorViz publication pages and repos.

key_contributions:
  - None — organization/index page for repositories

  Prefer CC053/CC077 for official tool positioning and CC080/CC108/CC084 for technical details. This org page is
  useful for discovering repos but is not itself a primary extraction source.
