summary: |
  Primary paper for Code Park (VISSOFT 2017): a 3D “game-like” code visualization tool that represents each class as a
  room and displays code elements as syntax-aware “wallpaper” on room walls. The tool supports both bird’s-eye and
  first-person navigation and uses orientation-preserving animated transitions for navigation actions (e.g., go-to-definition).
  Two user studies report improved code understanding versus a traditional IDE and high engagement (all participants found it fun).

key_contributions:
  - 3D “park” metaphor where classes are rooms and source code is shown directly on walls as syntax-aware wallpaper
  - Dual navigation modes (exocentric overview + egocentric first-person inspection) with animated transitions to preserve spatial awareness
  - Empirical evaluation: usability study (n=28) comparing against Visual Studio plus a follow-up organization study (n=9)

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 28
  dependent_variables: [qualitative post-task ratings, post-study preferences, task completion time]
  independent_variables: [tool (Code Park vs Visual Studio), codebase (LM vs MG)]
  key_findings:
    - "Participants rated Code Park significantly easier to get familiar with and more beneficial for learning a codebase than Visual Studio."
    - "All 28 participants reported Code Park as more enjoyable to use (engagement goal)."

quality_notes: |
  The arXiv record links to the full VISSOFT 2017 paper PDF; extraction is based on the full PDF. Code Park is implemented
  in Unity and (at publication time) supports only C#; the paper notes missing IDE features (editing/debugging) and potential
  bias from participants’ prior Visual Studio familiarity, mitigated via a mixed-effects study design. The second study (n=9)
  focuses on how users spatially organize classes and is summarized in the implementation notes rather than encoded as a
  separate empirical-evidence block here.
