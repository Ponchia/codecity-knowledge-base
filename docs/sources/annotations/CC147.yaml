summary: |
  Medium post introducing “City Blocks”, an open-source Three.js/WebGL-based 3D visualization of a Git repository that
  maps directories to stacked blocks and files to buildings, encoding size (LOC) and churn/commit activity using
  geometry and color. It gives a concise implementation sketch (CSV export + Node server + bin-packing placement) and
  positions the project as a CodeCity-like visualization focused on repo churn/size.

key_contributions:
  - Documents a CodeCity-adjacent 3D “repo city” visualization focused on churn (commits) and size (LOC)
  - Describes the concrete mapping rules (directories as stacked blocks; files as buildings; heat coloring by commit ratio)
  - Provides a high-level implementation outline (stats → CSV → Three.js renderer; DFS + bin packing; glob-based exclusions)
