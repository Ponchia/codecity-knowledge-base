summary: |
  Sílice/CSIC publication metadata page for “A landscape metaphor for visualization of software projects”
  (DOI: 10.1145/1409720.1409753). The abstract indicates a project-management visualization (risk/cost/schedule
  control) rather than software-city/city-metaphor visualization of code, so it is out of scope for this knowledge base.

  The captured page is a JS-heavy metadata/landing page; the visible content in the static capture is largely placeholders,
  but the HTML metadata provides the paper title, DOI, and a short abstract description.
