  Devendra, Wijesiriwardana, and Wimalaratne propose adaptive Level of Detail (LOD)
  for software security visualization using city metaphor. LOD dynamically adjusts
  based on user roles, tasks, code metrics, and real-time code changes.
key_contributions:
  - Adaptive LOD mechanism based on user roles and development tasks
  - Context-aware visualization responding to code metrics
  - Real-time LOD adjustment responding to code modifications
  - Content-aware switching between detail levels
terms_introduced:
  - adaptive LOD: "Dynamic adjustment of visualization detail based on user context, roles, and task requirements"
  - content-aware LOD switching: "Intelligent transition between detail levels based on content characteristics"
features_described:
  - F085  # adaptive-lod (NEW)
