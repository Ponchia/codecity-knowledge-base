summary: |
  Hansen et al. address visual scalability in 3D software cities through semantic zoom
  (camera-distance-responsive representations) and mini-map augmentation (2D top-view
  projection for navigation). Implemented in ExplorViz, evaluated with user studies
  showing utility for large landscapes and collaborative exploration.
key_contributions:
  - Semantic zoom mechanism where visual representation changes based on camera distance
  - Mini-map augmentation providing 2D top-view projection for navigation context
  - User study demonstrating utility for large software landscapes
  - Integration with live trace visualization in ExplorViz
terms_introduced:
  - semantic zoom: "Camera-distance-responsive mechanism where graphical representation changes based on virtual camera distance from objects"
  - mini-map: "Miniature two-dimensional top-view projection providing navigational context"
