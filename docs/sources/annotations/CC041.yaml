summary: |
  Introduces CodeVestimenta, an IDE plugin that visualizes object-oriented software using a clothing metaphor, mapping
  class-level metrics to garment attributes to support program comprehension. Presents a controlled study comparing
  text-only versus visual resources (41 completed participants) across 10 tasks and four scopes, reporting advantages
  for dependency analysis and design-quality assessment when the metaphor is available.

key_contributions:
  - Proposes the CodeVestimenta clothing metaphor for software visualization and program comprehension.
  - Defines a metric-to-garment mapping (size, sleeves, color, garment type, collar/belt, stripes) for OO metrics.
  - Reports an empirical evaluation (Text vs Visual groups) showing improvements in speed/accuracy on harder tasks.

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 41
  dependent_variables: [response_time, answer_correctness]
  independent_variables: [visualization_condition, task_scope]
  key_findings:
    - The visual metaphor helped on harder comprehension tasks, especially dependency and design-quality scopes.
  effect_size: unknown

quality_notes: |
  68 participants enrolled but 41 completed the tasks; results are limited to a single Java system and an image-based
  IDE plugin, so generalizability to other languages or workflows is uncertain.
