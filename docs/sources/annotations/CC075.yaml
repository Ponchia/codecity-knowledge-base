summary: |
  Proposes a visualization framework for large-scale software quality analysis using 3D class boxes and
  metric-driven encodings (color, height, and twist). The approach adapts Treemap and Sunburst layouts to
  discrete class glyphs, adds metric/structural filters, and reports an experiment comparing Treemap,
  Sunburst, and a naive “Treeline” layout.

key_contributions:
  - Maps class metrics to visual properties: CBO→color, LCOM5→twist, WMC→height
  - Adapts Treemap and Sunburst layouts to discrete 3D class boxes with package-aware separation
  - Introduces metric-distribution filters and UML-relation filters for focused analysis
  - Demonstrates design-principle violation detection, Blob anti-pattern identification, and evolution analysis
  - Provides an experimental comparison of layout techniques (Treemap, Sunburst, Treeline)

terms_introduced:
  - coupling
  - cohesion
  - CBO
  - LCOM5
  - WMC
  - DIT
  - Blob
  - sunburst
  - treeline

  key_findings:
    - "Average time (sec): Treemap 36.38, Sunburst 50.13, Treeline 69.88 (20 tasks, 15 subjects)."
    - "Median time (sec): Treemap 22.24, Sunburst 23.87, Treeline 41.24."
    - "Best-time ranking: Treemap 55%, Sunburst 35%, Treeline 10%."
    - "Subjective preference favored Sunburst (80% of subjects)."
  effect_size: "Times reported; no standardized effect size."

quality_notes: |
  Experiment tasks cover class-characteristics and architecture questions on programs ranging from 72 to 1662 classes.
  The study compares layouts rather than competing tools; results emphasize relative layout efficacy.
