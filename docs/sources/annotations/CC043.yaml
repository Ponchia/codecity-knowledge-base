summary: |
  SoftViz3D is a deprecated web-based tool (master-thesis project) for 3D visualization of software structures and
  dependencies. It renders hierarchical structure layers and a dependency view in the browser using X3DOM, relies on
  GraphViz for layout and edge routing (dot/neato), and includes a hierarchy-aware dependency expansion mechanism that
  aggregates dependencies into weighted path edges to keep large graphs readable.

key_contributions:
  - Documents an X3DOM-based web approach for 3D structure/dependency visualization (no native plugins)
  - Implements a dedicated dependency view with weighted edges (thickness encodes dependency counts)
  - Provides a hierarchy-aware dependency expansion that introduces interface nodes and “path” edges for aggregation
  - Shows interactive layer visibility control (show/remove/expand-all) to manage complexity in the 3D scene
  - Records deprecation rationale and migration path to a SonarQube-based successor (SoftVis3D)

terms_introduced:
  - X3DOM
  - GraphViz
  - Goanna

quality_notes: |
  The repo README marks the project as deprecated; it depends on older web/analysis components (Yii/PHP, X3DOM, PEAR
  GraphViz bindings) and appears to be a shallow local snapshot (single commit present in the local clone:
  aa6dd6d7b867b5ad7d4295569ff077c65b80a8a1, dated 2015-11-29).
