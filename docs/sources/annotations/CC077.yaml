summary: |
  ExplorViz “About” page describing ExplorViz as an open-source, web-based research tool for live trace visualization of software landscapes using the 3D city metaphor. It emphasizes dynamic analysis for system/program comprehension, “focus”-driven interaction (show details in focus), and the use of modern web/XR technologies (OpenTelemetry, WebGL, WebXR). The page also notes that static-analysis support is under development and that controlled experiments found ExplorViz more effective/efficient than competing approaches (without reporting details here).

key_contributions:
  - Confirms ExplorViz positioning: live trace visualization for software landscapes and single applications, with application communication details
  - Notes technology stack elements: OpenTelemetry (telemetry), WebGL (rendering), and WebXR (XR runtime in the browser)
  - States that static-analysis support is under development
  - Claims controlled experiments show increased efficiency/effectiveness over competing approaches (no metrics reported on this page)
