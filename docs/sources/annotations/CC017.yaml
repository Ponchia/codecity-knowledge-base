summary: |
  CodeCity’s homepage provides a concise overview of the tool’s city metaphor and implementation context: classes are
  rendered as buildings, packages as districts, and visual properties encode software metrics in the spirit of
  CodeCrawler’s polymetric views. It also notes the implementation platform (VisualWorks Smalltalk on Moose with
  OpenGL rendering) and cross‑platform availability.

key_contributions:
  - Confirms the core CodeCity mappings (classes→buildings, packages→districts) in an official project description
  - Cites the tool’s implementation stack: VisualWorks Smalltalk + Moose + OpenGL
  - Provides context on the broader publication trail for the approach (ICPC/VISSOFT/SoftVis/WASDeTT/WCRE/FAMOOSr)

  This is a high-level project page; it does not provide algorithmic details or evaluation evidence beyond pointing to
  the publication list. Treat as authoritative for the mapping statement and implementation platform only.
