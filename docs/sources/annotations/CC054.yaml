summary: |
  Presents “trend maps”, a technique that extends interactive software maps (2.5D treemaps) to visualize software-metric
  trends across a revision range in a single view. The approach computes per-entity time series from version control,
  aggregates metrics bottom-up in the hierarchy, and maps trend categories to natural-phenomena-inspired visual effects
  (surface materials and particle systems) implemented in Unreal Engine 4.

key_contributions:
  - Defines trend maps as an evolution visualization for software maps, based on metric time-series trends over a user-selected revision range
  - Introduces a design space of item-based (material/surface) vs context-based (surrounding particle effects) natural-phenomena metaphors
  - Describes an automatic effect parametrization pipeline (trend computation + discretization into five levels + mapping to effect parameter ranges)
  - Reports performance characteristics on two real repositories, including expensive preprocessing but interactive rendering frame times

terms_introduced: [software map, trend map, item-based metaphor, context-based metaphor]
features_described: [F005, F006, F007, F008, F015, F016, F018, F066]
implementations_documented: [I031]

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: benchmark
  sample_size: 2
  dependent_variables: [preprocessing time, aggregation time, frame time]
  independent_variables: [dataset size (items/revisions), selected revision range]
  key_findings:
    - "Preprocessing (72 metrics across all revisions) was expensive (≈4h for libzeug; ≈48h for PocoProject), but rendering stayed interactive (≈16ms and ≈43ms frame times)."
    - "Large revision ranges and large regions-of-interest can cause clutter/occlusion for context-based effects (e.g., fire)."
  effect_size: not reported

quality_notes: |
  No controlled user study is reported (future work proposes one). The visualization shows trends for entities present in
  a chosen revision x within the revision range; added/deleted entities within the range are not fully represented.
