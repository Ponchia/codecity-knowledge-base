summary: |
  2013 IEEE paper introducing CodeMetropolis, a C# command-line converter that turns
  Columbus source-code graphs into Minecraft worlds. It applies a city/metropolis
  metaphor with namespace plates (treemap), class districts, and method floors, mapping
  McCC to floor width/length and LLOC to floor height. The paper describes multilevel
  navigation in Minecraft (fly vs walk), early user feedback (six interviews), and
  prototype limitations with planned extensions (annotations, history, test coverage).

key_contributions:
  - Connects software city visualization to the Minecraft game engine for higher-fidelity graphics
  - Defines CodeMetropolis mappings (namespaces as plates, classes as districts, methods as floors)
  - Specifies metric encodings for methods (McCC -> width/length; LLOC -> height)
  - Introduces multilevel visualization via distance-based exploration (fly vs walk)
  - Reports early qualitative feedback from six interviews

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: user_study
  sample_size: 6
  dependent_variables: [qualitative feedback on navigation, perceived expressiveness, perceived learning curve]
  independent_variables: []
  key_findings:
    - Users raised concerns about navigation over large distances in big cities.
    - Positive impressions emphasized expressive power and motivation ("work while you play").
    - Users noted the limited number of simultaneously visible attributes (width/length/height).
  effect_size: not reported

quality_notes: |
  Prototype implementation with hardcoded mappings; only namespaces/classes/methods and two
  metrics (McCC, LLOC) are visualized in the current version. Output format and tooling are
  still under development, and several capabilities (annotations, history, test coverage) are
  described as future work rather than implemented features.
