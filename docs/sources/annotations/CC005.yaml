summary: |
  Third-party blog post summarizing CodeCity as an interactive, navigable 3D software city (packages as districts,
  classes as buildings) and positioning it alongside polymetric views (CodeCrawler). It also notes distribution and
  licensing details (platform packages and academic non-commercial usage constraints).

key_contributions:
  - Secondary confirmation of the core CodeCity concept mapping (packages→districts, classes→buildings)
  - Mentions distribution packaging (Mac/Windows packages; “image-only” distribution for other OS requiring VisualWorks)
  - Notes CodeCity’s academic non-commercial license limitation (as described on the page)
