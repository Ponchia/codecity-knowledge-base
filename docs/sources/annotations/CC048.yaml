summary: |
  URJC institutional portal metadata page for the JSS 2024 systematic mapping study “The influence of the city metaphor and its derivates in software visualization” (406 screened; 168 analyzed). Full extraction is already captured from the primary full-text/source entry (CC018), so this is treated as a duplicate metadata listing.
