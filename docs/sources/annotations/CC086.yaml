summary: |
  Detailed tool paper for CodeCity describing its city-metaphor mappings, interaction model (navigation + contextual
  menus + query mechanism), tool-chain integration (Moose/FAMIX, iPlasma, MSE), and modular architecture. It also
  documents tunable visualizations via view configurations and a mapper hierarchy (linear, boxplot, threshold, etc.),
  and reports build-time performance across multiple large systems.

key_contributions:
  - Official CodeCity overview including interaction via contextual menus and a query mechanism (absolute vs selection-relative queries)
  - Tool-chain description: Moose/FAMIX modeling, iPlasma extraction for Java/C++, MSE exchange, Jun/OpenGL rendering, and Mondrian blueprints
  - View configuration definition for tunable visualizations (visibility, glyphs, layouts, and visual mappers)
  - Mapper hierarchy and mapping strategies (identity/linear/cluster/boxplot/threshold) with scriptable mappers
  - Disharmony-map explanation inspired by disease maps (vivid colors for “harmony breakers”, neutral context for unaffected entities)
  - Performance table reporting build/render time for multiple systems up to ~1M LOC scale

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: benchmark
  sample_size: 9 open-source systems (Table 1)
  dependent_variables: [build_time_seconds]
  independent_variables: [system_size_kLOC, packages_count, classes_count]
  key_findings:
    - Build+render time increases with system size and visualization granularity; class-level cities remain interactive even for thousands of buildings when using simple glyphs.
  effect_size: (not reported)

quality_notes: |
  This is a tool/architecture paper with performance measurements and illustrative examples rather than a controlled
  user study. Several core details overlap with CC020/CC024/CC035, but CC086 is useful as a consolidated technical
  description (queries, mapper hierarchy, and view-configuration definition).
