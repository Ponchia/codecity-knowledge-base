summary: |
  Detailed WASDeTT 2008 paper describing CodeCity as a language-independent interactive 3D “software city”
  visualization tool (classes/buildings, packages/districts). Goes beyond the initial city-metaphor introduction by
  documenting the tool chain (Moose/FAMIX models, iPlasma extraction via MSE, Jun/OpenGL rendering), a modular
  architecture, the mapper hierarchy for tunable metric→visual mappings, and user/programmer-level customization
  via view configurations and scripting (inspired by Mondrian). Includes scalability/performance measurements across
  multiple real systems.

key_contributions:
  - Describes CodeCity’s tool chain and language-independence: Moose/FAMIX model, iPlasma for Java/C++ export (MSE), Jun/OpenGL rendering, and Mondrian class blueprints
  - Documents CodeCity’s module-level architecture (model/core/view management/rendering) and extensibility rationale
  - Defines “view configurations” as tunable specs (visibility, glyphs, layouts, mappers) with preview and save/reuse workflow
  - Presents the mapper class hierarchy (identity/linear/color/boxplot/threshold), including script-based persistence of configurations
  - Reports scalability/performance data (build+render time across systems up to ≈1M LOC) and engineering lessons (reflection, unit testing)

  - view configuration
  - MSE exchange format

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: performance_measurement
  sample_size: 9 systems (Java/C++/Smalltalk)
  dependent_variables: [build_time_seconds]
  independent_variables: [system_size, number_of_packages, number_of_classes]
  key_findings:
    - "Build+render times (class-level granularity) range from ~1.5s (CodeCity, 18 kLOC) to 260s (Azureus, 274 kLOC) on a 2.4GHz Core2Duo MacBook Pro."
    - "Rendering/navigation remains fluid for thousands of simple cuboid glyphs (e.g., Azureus ~5,000 figures), but finer granularity and relationship rendering increase build cost."
  effect_size: (not reported)

quality_notes: |
  Strong primary source for CodeCity’s architecture and configurability (mappers, view configurations, scripting).
  Mentions evolution/disharmony visualization as supported but not detailed here; deeper coverage exists in CC035 and
  related SoftVis publications.
  CC024 also points to several primary sources that are not currently indexed as CC### entries (e.g., the MSE format
  reference, Mondrian framework paper, and the “class blueprint” TSE 2005 paper), which may be worth ingesting
  separately if we want deeper coverage of the supporting tool chain.
