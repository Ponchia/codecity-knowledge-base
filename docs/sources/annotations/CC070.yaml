summary: |
  Presents IslandViz, a VR/AR visualization for component-based (OSGi) software architectures based on an island
  metaphor: bundles are islands, packages are regions, and class types are buildings. The approach mines repository data
  into a Neo4j graph database (via JQA SSISTANT) and supports multi-level exploration on a virtual table in VR and as an
  AR overlay on HoloLens, with gesture/gaze/voice interaction and basic collaboration.

key_contributions:
  - Island metaphor for modular software architectures (bundle→island, package→region, class→building) with dependency depiction via ports/arced arrows and service layers
  - Island construction algorithm using Voronoi tiling and a cohesion factor to control region “holes” and visual ruggedness
  - VR interaction model built around a virtual table (translate/rotate/scale) plus a hand-attached “virtual tablet” for details-on-demand text
  - AR mode on HoloLens using gesture/gaze/voice, including a state-machine interaction model and shared-state collaboration via MRTK
