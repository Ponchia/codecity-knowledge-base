summary: |
  Experience report on extending CodeCity with a scripting environment to support rapid prototyping of new 3D
  visualizations without repeatedly extending the GUI. It describes a Mondrian-inspired scripting interface (variables,
  code editor, generated visualization) and explains how view configurations can be exported as scripts and stored in
  Smalltalk’s versioning system (Store) to make configurations resilient to refactorings.

key_contributions:
  - Adds a scripting environment to CodeCity for ad-hoc visualization prototyping beyond pre-defined city views
  - Describes a Mondrian-inspired scripting UI and its relationship to CodeCity’s view-configuration mechanism
  - Motivates persisting view configurations as scripts tracked by Store instead of file-serialized configs that break under renaming
