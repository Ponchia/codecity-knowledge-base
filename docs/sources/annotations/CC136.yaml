summary: |
  Open-source 3D code-city proof of concept focused on visualizing **code ownership** using version-control blame data.
  Each file is rendered as a building (height = line count) within folder districts, and each building is subdivided into
  segments derived from `git blame` hunks that are colored by author. The project provides a Dockerized Angular/NestJS
  stack with a backend that scans local Git repositories for analysis input.

key_contributions:
  - Code-ownership visualization: per-file building segmentation by blame hunks with author-based coloring
  - Concrete web implementation (Angular + Three.js frontend; NestJS backend using NodeGit) with Docker deployment
