summary: |
  ICSEng 2025 preprint introducing Code Arcades, a desktop 3D software-city visualization for C++ that renders
  packages as blocks and classes as buildings, adds fine-grained method floors (with windows for arguments), and
  visualizes typed dependencies between classes. The paper emphasizes configurability: users can adjust rendering
  attributes and metric encodings interactively, and can group classes by namespaces or architecture-recovery-derived
  components.

key_contributions:
  - Configurable grouping mechanism to organize classes by arbitrary relations (e.g., recovered architecture components), not only package hierarchy
  - Interactive configuration UI for changing metric encodings and rendering attributes (colors, dimensions, materials/textures)
  - Multi-level city representation including method floors and argument windows, plus typed dependency visualization between classes

quality_notes: |
  Preprint; no formal evaluation results are reported. The work targets C++ and relies on a separate architecture-recovery
  toolchain; future work mentions adding VCS evolution analysis and empirical usability studies.
