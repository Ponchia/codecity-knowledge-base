summary: |
  Archived repository snapshot of the ExplorViz web client. It confirms a WebGL/HTML5 stack
  for live trace visualization of communication in software landscapes, with an application-
  level 3D city view. The repo adds concrete evidence for time-shift navigation over runtime
  traces, a CodeMirror-based source-code viewer, an OpenSCAD export path for 3D printing, and
  WebVR/Leap Motion integration.

key_contributions:
  - Confirms the web-based WebGL/HTML5 client stack and archived status of this ExplorViz codebase
  - Implements live landscape exchange with time-shift selection of historical runtime snapshots
  - Provides a source-code viewer service and UI (context-menu “Inspect source code”)
  - Adds OpenSCAD export for printable 3D models (labels, lids, puzzle cuts)
  - Includes WebVR + Leap Motion integration scaffolding for immersive interaction
