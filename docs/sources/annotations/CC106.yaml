summary: |
  Introduces VR City, a VR software-analysis tool for HTC Vive that adapts the software-city metaphor to support static,
  dynamic (trace), and evolution analysis. The paper contributes a coupling-driven layout algorithm (spectral ordering +
  Hilbert-curve placement), a fine-grained method-as-floors representation, in-VR source-code browsing via movable code
  labels, and VR interactions such as room-scale walking and teleportation.

key_contributions:
  - Coupling-driven city layout from a weighted class-dependency graph using spectral ordering (Fiedler vector) and Hilbert-curve placement
  - Fine-grained method visualization as floors within class buildings (floors sized by per-method metric values)
  - Dynamic trace mode with per-trace coloring/translucency; traces recorded via Eclipse inTrace (no source modification)
  - Evolution animation over commit ranges with author “avatars” (colored spheres) moving through waypoints derived from modified classes
  - Remodularization analysis mode comparing packages vs semantic clusters via color schemes over the coupling layout

terms_introduced:
  - remodularization analysis
  - semantic cluster
  - spectral ordering
  - Fiedler vector
  - Hilbert curve
  - teleportation

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: case_study
  sample_size: 2 open-source systems (JHotDraw 7.0.6, JUnit 4)
  dependent_variables: [qualitative_findings]
  independent_variables: (not applicable)
  key_findings:
    - The fine-grained floor representation can expose method-level size distribution (e.g., oversized base floors suggesting long methods).
    - Trace playback highlights which classes/methods participate in executions and supports comparing overlapping traces via color.

quality_notes: |
  This is a tool/approach paper with illustrative case studies, not a controlled user study. Some claims about benefits
  (e.g., reduced cognitive load via VR) are motivated by prior VR literature; the primary technical contribution is the
  coupling-based layout plus interaction/analysis modes described for the prototype.
