  Full-text HAL PDF preprint (JSS “in press”, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2023.111876) describing VariCity, a configurable 3D software-city visualization for comprehending implemented OO variability. VariCity encodes method- and constructor-level variability (via height/width) and renders usage and inheritance relationships as different street types, while VariMetrics overlays software-quality metrics (from SonarCloud/SonarQube) using configurable color/texture strategies to highlight technical-debt-critical zones. The paper reports evaluations on multiple variability-rich Java systems and a controlled experiment (24 vs 25 subjects) showing improved performance on several variability-comprehension tasks, and provides replication artifacts and a Zenodo reproduction package.

key_contributions:
  - VariCity: city-metaphor visualization for OO variability comprehension, encoding method vs constructor overload density via building dimensions
  - Relationship-as-streets design: plan/underground usage streets and aerial inheritance streets (with additional links shown on hover)
  - VariMetrics extension: overlays OO quality metrics using configurable strategies (red↔green, saturation, crackled texture) to surface variability debt/technical-debt-critical zones
  - Empirical evaluation on real systems plus a controlled experiment vs IDE+CSV baseline, with replication materials and reproduction package

terms_introduced: [software variability, technical debt, variability debt, variation point, variant]
features_described: [F001, F002, F006, F016, F035, F037, F065]
implementations_documented: [I030]

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 49
  dependent_variables: [correctness, task duration, perceived difficulty]
  independent_variables: [tool (VariCity vs IDE + CSV)]
  key_findings:
    - VariCity users gave statistically more correct answers on 6/11 tasks, especially for tasks involving complex variability structures (e.g., design patterns and hotspots).
    - VariCity was faster on tasks 3, 6, 7, and 8 (and the IDE + CSV baseline was faster on task 2).
    - Perceived difficulty favored VariCity on tasks focused on design patterns/hotspots/distance between classes (tasks 6–9).
