summary: |
  WCRE 2008 paper presenting interactive 3D visualizations for understanding the structural evolution of large OO systems
  using the city metaphor. It introduces three evolution techniques—age maps, time travel, and timelines—at both coarse
  (class/package) and fine (method “bricks”) granularity. The authors apply the techniques to ArgoUML, JHotDraw, and
  Jmol and report findings that were confirmed by developers.

key_contributions:
  - Introduces an evolution-focused visualization approach for code cities: age maps, time travel, and timelines
  - Demonstrates both coarse-grained and fine-grained evolution views (class/package vs method-level bricks)
  - Provides concrete case-study insights (e.g., long-lived duplications; major refactorings visible as births/deaths over time)

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: case_study
  sample_size: 3 systems (ArgoUML, JHotDraw, Jmol)
  dependent_variables: [qualitative evolution insights, developer confirmation of findings]
  independent_variables: []
  key_findings:
    - Coarse-grained age maps can distinguish long-lived artifacts from recently introduced packages/classes, helping frame evolution questions.
    - Time travel across ArgoUML versions makes large refactorings visible as “birth/death” events and geometry changes (e.g., a large facade class replaced by an interface and multiple implementors).
    - Fine-grained timelines support method-level reasoning about when functionality appears/disappears across versions.

quality_notes: |
  The paper reports illustrative case studies and developer confirmation rather than a controlled user study. Detailed
  algorithms and broader context are expanded in the later thesis (CC035), but CC116 is the primary paper introducing
  the age-map/time-travel/timeline triad in a compact form.
