summary: |
  Benelux 2019 workshop paper proposing a modern, web-based CodeCity implementation built on BabiaXR/A-Frame,
  motivated by device accessibility and by adding explicit time evolution of the city. It describes generating CodeCity
  JSON inputs from Git repositories (Graal/Perceval + ElasticSearch) and replaying snapshots while keeping building
  positions stable via per-building identifiers.

key_contributions:
  - Early BabiaXR CodeCity prototype focused on time evolution in a browser (WebVR/A-Frame)
  - Stable evolution approach: keep building positions fixed across snapshots and update only geometry (area/height) via unique IDs
  - Provides a reproduction package link for replicating the workshop paper’s examples

quality_notes: |
  Proof-of-concept/work-in-progress paper; future work lists additional interaction ideas (e.g., small overview city vs
  full-scale in-city navigation like driving/flying) and expanding beyond structural metrics. A reproduction package is
  referenced in a footnote (GitLab link in the PDF text).
