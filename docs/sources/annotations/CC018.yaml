summary: |
  Systematic mapping study examining the influence of the software “city metaphor” across the software visualization literature.
  The authors screen 406 publications citing the early city-metaphor/CodeCity papers and extract categorial information from 168,
  reporting trends over time and tool adoption characteristics (including extended reality usage).

key_contributions:
  - Systematic mapping of city-metaphor influence: 406 citing publications screened; 168 included for detailed extraction
  - Reports field growth since 2001 and an evolving research community/network of groups
  - Reports tool-reporting gaps: less than 50% of city-metaphor tools are referenced in their papers
  - Reports XR adoption gap: 85% of tools do not use extended reality environments (highlighting an opportunity for further XR research)
  - Declares open access (CC BY 4.0) and points to a Zenodo replication package (link referenced in the paper)

terms_introduced:
  - systematic mapping study
  - extended reality (XR)

secondary_study:
  study_type: systematic_mapping
  corpus_size: 406
  included_studies: 168
  key_findings:
    - The city metaphor remains active and continues to grow as a research topic (publication trend since 2001).
    - Tool documentation/citation is inconsistent: <50% of city-metaphor tools are referenced in their papers.
    - Extended reality is underused: 85% of tools do not use XR environments, though XR usage is trending upward.
  data_availability: "Replication package hosted in Zenodo (link referenced in the paper)."

quality_notes: |
  The locally captured ScienceDirect page includes structured metadata (highlights, keywords, dates, license) and the structured abstract,
  but does not include the full article body due to access restrictions in the capture. Extracted knowledge is therefore limited to what is
  present in the abstract/metadata; revisit when a full-text PDF or replication package is available.
