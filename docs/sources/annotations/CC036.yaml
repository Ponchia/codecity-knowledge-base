summary: |
  Introduces JSCity, an open-source, browser-based implementation of the CodeCity “software city” metaphor for
  JavaScript systems. JSCity visualizes folders as districts, files as sub-districts, and functions as buildings, including
  explicit visualization of nested functions as stacked buildings. Describes the tool’s JavaScript implementation
  pipeline (Esprima AST extraction + Three.js rendering) and reports experience producing cities for 40 popular
  JavaScript projects.

key_contributions:
  - Adapts the city metaphor to JavaScript by mapping functions (not classes) to buildings and supporting anonymous + nested functions
  - Defines concrete metric mappings for JavaScript: LOC→height, number of variables (NOV)→footprint, named/anonymous→color
  - Documents a browser-native implementation approach using Esprima (AST) and Three.js
  - Reports experience generating visualizations for 40 popular JavaScript systems and summarizes observed structural patterns
  - Positions the tool as low-friction to use (runs in standard web browsers without specialized visualization installs)

terms_introduced:
  - Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  - Esprima
  - Three.js
  - number of variables (NOV)

features_described: [F001, F003, F005, F006, F007, F017, F043]

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: case_study
  sample_size: 40 JavaScript systems
  dependent_variables: [qualitative_patterns]
  independent_variables: (not applicable)
  key_findings:
    - "Tall and wide buildings often correspond to core functions."
    - "Large districts with many small buildings can reflect large groups of small utility functions (e.g., internationalization code)."
    - "Anonymous functions and nested functions are common in practice."
  effect_size: (not reported)

quality_notes: |
  This is a short arXiv paper focused on describing a tool and its mappings; it does not report a controlled user study.
  The implementation and interaction details are high-level, but sufficient to document a browser-based pipeline and
  JavaScript-specific mapping choices.
