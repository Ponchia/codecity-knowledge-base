summary: |
  SoftVis3D is a SonarQube-integrated WebGL “code city” visualization that maps folders/packages to districts and files
  to buildings. The site documents layout options (including an “Evostreet” stable layout), profile presets for common
  quality tasks, regex-based include/exclude filtering, and several color metrics including SCM blame-based author/commit
  signals with explicit limitations (no SCM history).

key_contributions:
  - Documents a SonarQube extension that brings software-city visualization into an existing quality platform workflow
  - Specifies default “profile” presets (risk / leak period / duplicated lines) and the metrics they select
  - Clarifies limitations of SCM-derived metrics (authors/commits derived from current-line blame only)
  - Provides shareable example links with an embedded `visualizationStatus` configuration (layout, metrics, filters)

terms_introduced:
  - bus factor
  - leak period
  - WebGL
  - SonarQube

quality_notes: |
  The page is primarily user-facing documentation/marketing; it does not describe layout algorithms in detail beyond the
  city metaphor and high-level layout descriptions. Metric semantics are mostly delegated to SonarQube/SonarSource.
