summary: |
  Unity-based “dynamic software city” prototype that builds a package/class city from a static dependency graph (DOT)
  and overlays dynamic runtime dependencies and component load aggregated from ElasticSearch-exported spans and
  transactions. The visualization supports time-sliced exploration (bucket stepping via keyboard) and selection-scoped
  dependency focus (click to filter visible arcs) while recoloring buildings and arcs based on aggregated load and HTTP
  status-code categories.

key_contributions:
  - Combines static DOT dependency graphs with ElasticSearch APM span/transaction data in a single city view
  - Aggregates dynamic load into time buckets with interactive stepping (left/right arrows)
  - Encodes dynamic load via building color and curved dependency arcs, incorporating HTTP status categories
  - Provides selection-driven filtering of dependency arcs to reduce clutter
  - Maps coupling metrics from the dependency graph (fan-in/fan-out) to building geometry (height/footprint)

  Repo snapshot at commit dac91924b2530d9dd2006c3792034b45b45bf099 (2022-06-27). No top-level README is present in
  this snapshot; behavior was inferred directly from Unity scripts (notably `UnitySoftwareCity` and
  `DynamicDependenciesVisualizer`) and bundled evaluation spreadsheets in `Eval/`.
