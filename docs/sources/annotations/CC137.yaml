summary: |
  Unity-based software-city visualization (Holoware/DynaCity codebase) that builds a package/class city from a `.dot`
  dependency graph, derives an LSM-like layering, and renders multiple views: static cycle visualization, “use case”
  trace arcs, and an error-code-focused dynamic dependency overlay based on ElasticSearch-exported APM spans and
  transactions. The repo also bundles raw experimental data spreadsheets comparing two layout variants (binpacking vs
  levelized) on correctness/time for comprehension tasks, plus a questionnaire on dependency/use-case filtering.

key_contributions:
  - Constructs a layered software city from a DOT dependency graph (LSM-derived levels used for “levelized” row layout)
  - Implements dynamic trace overlays from ElasticSearch span/transaction JSON with time-frame navigation and HTTP-status-based coloring
  - Provides selection-scoped dependency filtering (hide all arcs except those related to the selected component)
  - Includes a “use case” trace view that can step through use cases and points of interest over time
  - Bundles raw evaluation spreadsheets for task correctness/time and filter-preference questionnaires

  key_findings:
    - Repo includes raw per-task correctness and timing spreadsheets for 7 comprehension tasks (15 rows each for both “binpacking” and “levelized” files).
    - Repo includes a filter-preference questionnaire spreadsheet (22 response rows) about dependency/use-case filtering usefulness.

quality_notes: |
  Repo snapshot at commit 6af6f83e7217eb937dfa18ef736e5e48603df9ab. The README references two 2021 publications
  (“A Layered Software City for Dependency Visualization” and “Trace Visualization within the Software City Metaphor:
  A Controlled Experiment on Program Comprehension”) that are not currently indexed in `bibliography/index.csv` and
  should be added as primary sources.
