summary: |
  Introduces Software Galaxies, a 3D visualization using a galaxy/astronomy metaphor.
  Layout based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on source code for semantic similarity.
  Files/clusters rendered as stars/nebulae rather than buildings/districts.
key_contributions:
  - Novel galaxy metaphor as alternative to city metaphor
  - LDA-based semantic similarity layout (NLP on source code)
  - Captures semantic relatedness rather than structural hierarchy
terms_introduced:
  - galaxy metaphor: "Visualization metaphor depicting software as a galaxy with files as stars and clusters as nebulae, arranged by semantic similarity"
  - semantic layout: "Layout algorithm based on NLP/LDA similarity extracted from source code identifiers and comments"
features_described:
  - F076  # galaxy-metaphor (NEW)
  - F077  # semantic-similarity-layout (NEW)

quality_notes: |
  VINCI 2021 paper by Atzberger et al. (HPI Potsdam). First experiments show
  potential for program comprehension. Differentiator: uses semantic similarity
  from NLP rather than structural hierarchy for layout.
