summary: |
  Master’s thesis (Karlstad University, 2025) that integrates reflexion-model architectural analysis into a 3D
  “code city” visualization by extending SoftVis3D. The prototype maps architecture modules to an island-based layout
  and visualizes module and class dependencies as arrows, highlighting architectural violations and enabling drill-down
  from module-level to class-level relations. A small remote task-based user study (n=5) evaluates usefulness and reports
  perceived value for onboarding and architecture understanding (mean impact rating 4.2/5).

key_contributions:
  - Integrates reflexion-model architecture plans with a 3D code visualization (SoftVis3D) via an island-based module layout
  - Visualizes architecture-conforming vs violating dependencies (module-to-module arrows) with drill-down to class-to-class arrows and class highlighting
  - Reports a small user study (n=5) and documents observed usability issues/limitations plus replication repositories

terms_introduced: [reflexion model, architectural erosion]

features_described: [F025, F030, F068, F070]
implementations_documented: [I019]

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: user_study
  sample_size: 5
  dependent_variables: [task completion, qualitative usefulness ratings]
  independent_variables: [tasks (module navigation, dependency/violation identification)]
  key_findings:
    - "Participants recognized value for onboarding and understanding undocumented systems; mean reported impact was 4.2/5."
    - "Violation filtering and dependency drill-down supported locating architecture problems, but arrow overlap/selection precision hindered detailed analysis."

quality_notes: |
  The DiVA record provides an open-access PDF; extraction is based on the full thesis PDF. The prototype is system-specific:
  architecture module mappings and ~7,000 class dependencies for Apache Lucene are hard-coded in the client, limiting
  generalizability. The thesis references Murphy et al.’s reflexion models paper as the conceptual basis; that primary
  source is not currently indexed in this bibliography.
