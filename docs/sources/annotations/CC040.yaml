summary: |
  Open-source repository for SoftVis3D, a SonarQube plugin + web frontend that renders a software “code city” using
  Three.js/WebGL and the `codecity-visualizer` layout engine (district and evostreet). The repo provides concrete
  metric IDs, profile presets, scaling strategies (log/exponential/linear variants), URL-serialized view-state sharing,
  and SCM blame-derived author/commit signals loaded via SonarQube APIs.

key_contributions:
  - Establishes project inception year (2015) and module architecture (SonarQube plugin + TypeScript/React frontend)
  - Defines profile presets (default risk, leak period, duplicated lines) and default scaling (logarithmic)
  - Documents and implements multiple metric scaling strategies (logarithmic, exponential, linear-scaled, linear)
  - Implements shareable deep links by serializing view state (layout/metrics/filters/selection/camera) into `visualizationStatus`
  - Implements SCM blame-based metrics by calling SonarQube’s SCM endpoint and deriving `number_of_authors` / `number_of_commits`

terms_introduced:
  - bus factor
  - leak period
  - WebGL
  - SonarQube
  - SCM blame

quality_notes: |
  Repository snapshot appears shallow (single commit present in the local clone: b1418e02d16b1eea238d4bed346fc46c005eeea9).
  Earlier plugin versions referenced in the repo README mention a Graphviz dependency; the current frontend uses
  `codecity-visualizer` + Three.js instead.
