summary: |
  Dissertation introducing ExplorViz, a live trace visualization approach for understanding large software landscapes
  via two coupled perspectives: a landscape-level (UML-inspired) view and an application-level 3D software city view.
  It details a monitoring/analysis pipeline for high-volume method-call traces, a time-shift mode and other interaction
  concepts (including a gesture-controlled VR setup), and reports multiple empirical evaluations.

key_contributions:
  - End-to-end description of ExplorViz for live trace visualization in large software landscapes (landscape + software-city perspectives)
  - Monitoring and analysis approach designed to scale to high-volume traces with low overhead, including evaluation against Kieker baselines
  - Time-shifted trace analysis and interaction concepts beyond 2D displays/pointing devices, including a gesture-controlled VR setup (Oculus Rift DK1 + Kinect v2)
  - Reports controlled experiments showing increased efficiency/effectiveness for comprehension tasks versus baseline tools (e.g., ExplorViz vs Extravis; landscape view vs APM-style visualizations)

terms_introduced: [time shift mode]

features_described: [F014, F041, F011, F069]
implementations_documented: [I009]

empirical_evidence:
  study_type: controlled_experiment
  sample_size: 30
  dependent_variables: [task correctness, task completion time]
  independent_variables: [tool (ExplorViz vs baseline visualization)]
  key_findings:
    - "ExplorViz vs Extravis on PMD comprehension tasks: ExplorViz was more efficient and effective."
    - "Replication on Babsi (n=50): time differences were not significant, but correctness was significantly higher with ExplorViz."
    - "Landscape-level experiment vs APM-style visualizations: time differences were not significant, but correctness was significantly higher with ExplorViz."
  effect_size: not reported
