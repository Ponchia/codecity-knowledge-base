summary: |
  PhD dissertation proposing “consistent software cities” for evolving software systems. Introduces the EvoStreets
  layout approach that encodes evolution in the street structure while preserving spatial order across versions.
  Defines a software model and data-collection pipeline (Software Cockpit), presents thematic evolution maps
  (authorship, modification history, coupling), and extends the metaphor to software city landscapes representing
  component architecture. Includes an empirical evaluation of layout consistency and multiple case studies.

key_contributions:
  - Defines the EvoStreets layout approach for consistent software cities that preserve spatial order during evolution.
  - Presents a software model and Software Cockpit pipeline for collecting structure and evolution data.
  - Demonstrates thematic evolution maps (authorship, modification history, coupling) on stable layouts.
  - Introduces software city landscapes that combine multiple cities to represent component architectures.
  - Empirically evaluates layout consistency and reports case-study findings across academic and industrial systems.

  Dissertation spans software visualization broadly; only the software-city/evolution and landscape chapters were
  extracted here. Some results are qualitative case studies rather than controlled user experiments.
