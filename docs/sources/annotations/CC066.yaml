summary: |
  Survey-style “state of the art” discourse on software-architecture visualization techniques, covering hierarchy,
  relationships, evolution, and quality views. It includes software-city work as part of evolution visualization and
  summarizes an “evolving software cities” approach using streets/packages and building plots/classes, plus contour-line
  evolution and modification-history maps.

key_contributions:
  - Provides a broad overview of architecture-visualization techniques (hierarchy, relationship, evolution, metrics) and common tradeoffs (scalability/clutter/navigation)
  - Summarizes evolution-visualization approaches, including software-city techniques (CodeCity age maps/time travel/timelines) and “evolving cities” variants
  - Highlights stakeholder needs and the importance of choosing metaphors and interactions appropriate to analysis goals
