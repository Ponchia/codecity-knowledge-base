summary: |
  Introduces m3triCity, a web-based platform for visualizing Git repositories as evolving software cities. The paper
  presents an evolution model inspired by Hismo (adapted to Git) and a history-resistant layout that keeps artifacts at
  fixed positions across versions, enabling smoother time traversal and explicit visualization of structural refactorings
  (moves/renames) as animated relocations.

key_contributions:
  - Treats evolution as a first-class concept for software cities, addressing “layout jumps” during time traversal
  - Defines an advanced evolution model for Git (repository/package/class histories over versions)
  - Introduces a history-resistant layout that pre-allocates final space for entities to keep placement stable over time
  - Visualizes structural refactorings as explicit movements, using 3D edge bundling to draw relocation arcs
  - Provides interactive evolution UX: timeline-based navigation, time bucketing, hover inspection, regex hiding, tagging/colorization, and elision

terms_introduced:
  - history-resistant layout
  - time bucketing
  - elision

  key_findings:
    - "JetUML case study (2015–2018) demonstrates stable layout and explicit visualization of package/class move refactorings."
    - "A JetUML maintainer reported the visualization perspective was consistent with his recollection and helped identify maturation events not obvious from release notes."

quality_notes: |
  The primary evidence is a single-system case study (JetUML) with qualitative maintainer feedback; no quantitative
  performance or controlled user-study results are reported.
