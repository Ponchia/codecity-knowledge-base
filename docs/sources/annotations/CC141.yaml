summary: |
  Duplicate of CC077: the captured “website mirror” content is an ExplorViz MkDocs “About” page whose canonical URL
  points to https://explorviz.dev/1-about/ and repeats the same high-level positioning (OpenTelemetry/WebGL/WebXR,
  focus-driven interaction, and “controlled experiments” claim without details).
