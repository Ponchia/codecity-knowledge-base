summary: |
  SANER 2019 paper introducing GoCity, a web-based Code City implementation for Go. It adapts the
  city metaphor to Go’s structs/files, specifies metric encodings (methods/attributes/LOC), and
  documents the tool architecture (processing + front-end modules). The paper also reports a user
  feedback survey (12 responses) and usage scenarios on popular Go projects.

key_contributions:
  - Adapts the city metaphor to Go (files as buildings, structs stacked on file buildings, folders as districts)
  - Defines GoCity metric encodings (attributes/fields → base size, methods → height, LOC → color intensity)
  - Describes GoCity’s two-module architecture (processing services, frontend validation/3D/navigation)
  - Reports user feedback from 12 Go developers on design/modularization insights and maintenance support
  - Provides usage scenarios and hover-based metric inspection plus GitHub linking
