summary: |
  BabiaXR A-Frame component library that includes software-city visualizers for web/VR (WebXR), notably a treemap-like
  city component (`babia-city`) and a spiral-style “boats” layout (`babia-boats`). The repo also includes an evolution
  playback mode (`babiaxr-codecity`) driven by commit/time snapshots, plus multi-user demos using Networked-AFrame.

key_contributions:
  - Implements both treemap-like and spiral-style city layouts as reusable A-Frame components
  - Provides time-evolution playback driven by snapshot JSON (date + optional commit SHA) with animated geometry updates
  - Includes UI support for switching which data fields map to visual properties (e.g., height/area/color)
  - Demonstrates multi-user shared exploration (Networked-AFrame) with a software-city dataset (JetUML) rendered via `babia-boats`
