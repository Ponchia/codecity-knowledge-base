summary: |
  Richard Wettel’s publications list. This page primarily aggregates links to papers already tracked elsewhere in the
  bibliography (e.g., VISSOFT 2007, WCRE 2008, SoftVis 2008, ICSE 2011) and does not provide additional technical
  details beyond citations.

quality_notes: |
  Useful as a pointer to missing primary sources (e.g., a listed CodeCity technical report), but not itself a technical
  source for feature extraction. Prefer the actual PDFs already indexed (e.g., CC023/CC024/CC025/CC116/CC117/CC120).
