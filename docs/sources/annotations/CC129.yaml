summary: |
  Deprecated SonarQube plugin implementing SoftVis3D’s “city” and “dependency” views. The plugin requires Graphviz
  (dot) to compute layered layouts and renders dependencies as aggregated edges after a hierarchy-aware dependency
  expansion step that inserts synthetic interface nodes. Dependency edges are weighted (e.g., thickness) by the number
  of underlying dependencies merged into each aggregated path edge.

key_contributions:
  - City and dependency views integrated into SonarQube (“SoftVis3D Viewer”)
  - Graphviz/dot-based layout generation for layered platforms and dependency routing
  - Dependency-path expansion with synthetic interface nodes and aggregation counters
  - Edge thickness mapping using Graphviz `penwidth` derived from aggregated dependency counts
  - Documented deployment requirements (Graphviz path setting) and SonarQube compatibility matrix

quality_notes: |
  Repo README marks the plugin as deprecated; development moved to the SoftVis3D wrapper project.
  Snapshot at commit bdd18863aa334acfeefe88e37422ac1c29f586fa (2016-02-07). Evidence for dependency handling comes
  primarily from code (e.g., `DependencyExpander`, `GrappaEdgeFactory`) rather than a paper-level description.
