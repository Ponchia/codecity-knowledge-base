summary: |
  Prototype “metaverse” code-city demo built with Three.js/TypeScript. It renders a treemap-based 3D city from a
  bundled `data.json` (LOC and Git-change signals) and includes WebXR scaffolding (VRButton/controllers), but the repo
  is positioned as an experimental/for-fun PoC rather than a documented software-city analysis tool.

key_contributions:
  - None — exploratory prototype; overlaps established WebXR/Three.js city implementations already covered elsewhere

quality_notes: |
  The repository demonstrates a basic d3-treemap → 3D cuboid mapping and WebXR boilerplate, but does not provide
  domain-specific analysis workflows or validated extraction-worthy features beyond what is already represented in the
  corpus (e.g., BabiaXR/SoftVis3D/WebXR-based cities).
