summary: |
  Open-source reference implementation (MaibornWolff) of a software “city/map” visualization pipeline.
  Provides a CLI (`ccsh`) that produces `cc.json` maps from multiple sources (parsers/importers/filters) and a Web Studio
  (web + Electron desktop) that renders file/folder hierarchies as interactive 3D treemaps/streets with configurable
  metric mappings, delta comparison between two maps, and export options including 3D printing.

key_contributions:
  - End-to-end toolchain: analysis CLI + interactive 3D visualization (web + desktop) with local-only processing (no telemetry)
  - File/folder city metaphor: files as buildings, folders as districts; user-selectable metric mappings (area/height/color)
  - Multiple layout algorithms (squarified treemap, street-like layouts, hybrid variants)
  - Evolution support via delta comparison view (compare two maps; default red=removed, green=added)
  - Interchange format (`cc.json`) with schema evolution (nodes, optional edges, metric descriptors, optional fixed positions)
  - Export capabilities including 3D model export for 3D printing (STL/3MF)

quality_notes: |
  Strong implementation-focused source (not a research publication). Repository docs cover both the data model (`cc.json`)
  and the user-facing visualization features; some behavior is version-dependent (see changelogs and schema changelog).
