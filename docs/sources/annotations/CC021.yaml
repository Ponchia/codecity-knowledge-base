summary: |
  CLEI 2023 paper reporting an educational user study of a 3D software-city visualization. In a software engineering
  course, 16 participants used the city to understand a web application’s structure and identify development/quality
  best-practice issues; perceptions were measured using UEQ and TAM constructs, with generally positive results and
  noted opportunities around ease of use and visualization comprehension.

key_contributions:
  - Empirical evidence (education setting) that a 3D city metaphor can support program comprehension and surface quality-related improvement opportunities
  - Reports participant perceptions via UEQ and technology-acceptance constructs (ease of use, usefulness, intention to use)

  study_type: user_study
  sample_size: 16
  dependent_variables: [user experience (UEQ), perceived usefulness (TAM), perceived ease of use (TAM), intention to use (TAM)]
  independent_variables: []
  key_findings:
    - Participants generally evaluated acceptance and user-experience constructs positively in the course context.
    - The visualization helped participants identify improvement opportunities in development and software-quality practices.
    - The authors report opportunities for improvement around ease of use and visualization comprehension.
