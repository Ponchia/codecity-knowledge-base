summary: |
  Armenti, Raglianti, and Lanza present a multisensory approach combining sonification
  and visualization to represent software evolution. Uses a "heartbeat" metaphor to
  convey temporal dynamics of code changes through audio encoding.
key_contributions:
  - Multisensory approach combining audio and visual for evolution understanding
  - Heartbeat metaphor for conveying temporal dynamics of code changes
  - Integration of sonification with traditional visualization techniques
terms_introduced:
  - heartbeat metaphor: "Audio representation of code evolution tempo/rhythm conveying change dynamics"
  - evolution sonification: "Encoding software change patterns as audio signals over time"
features_described:
  - F084  # evolution-sonification (NEW)
