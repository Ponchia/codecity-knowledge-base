summary: |
  Richard Wettel’s personal homepage with biographical information and news. It mentions CodeCity and points to a
  “CodeCity experiment” page with replication “treatment kits”, but does not describe the city metaphor, mappings,
  or tool details beyond what is covered in the primary CodeCity sources already indexed.

key_contributions:
  - None — biographical/announcement page; CodeCity technical details are covered by CC017/CC023/CC035/CC086

quality_notes: |
  Includes a pointer to an unindexed subpage (`codecity-experiment.html`) that appears to host replication materials
  (“treatment kits”) for the CodeCity controlled experiment; consider ingesting that subpage as a separate source.
