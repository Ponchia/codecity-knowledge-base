summary: |
  TH Köln publication page for the IEEE VR 2018 work describing IslandViz, a VR visualization for OSGi-based software
  systems using an island metaphor (modules as islands) rendered on a virtual table. The linked preprint/poster PDF
  adds interaction details (translate/rotate/scale with zoom-as-LOD) and scale/performance notes from a case study.

key_contributions:
  - IslandViz in VR for OSGi: modules/bundles as islands, packages as regions, classes as buildings; dependencies shown via arced arrows
  - Virtual-table interaction model (translation/rotation/scale), with zoom tied to transitions across island/region/building layers
  - Reports a case-study scale (RCE subset) and performance notes (>90 Hz on HTC Vive) for interactive exploration

quality_notes: |
  The primary artifact is a publication page; the linked preprint is a short (2-page) poster-style PDF rather than a full
  paper. CC070 provides a more complete design/implementation description across VR and AR.
