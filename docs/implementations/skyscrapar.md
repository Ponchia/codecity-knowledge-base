# SkyscrapAR

## Overview

Augmented reality city-metaphor visualization for Java systems. CC015 describes it as similar to CodeCity but using code churn for building height, projected onto a physical marker card for manipulation.

## CC015 Table 1

- **Language**: Java
- **VR**: AR
- **Building**: class
- **Source code**: n/a
- **Static**: churn
- **Dynamic**: n/a
- **Instrumentation**: n/a

## Notes (from CC015)

CC015 defines churn here as change volume (lines changed) and notes it may correlate with defect probability.
