# UML-City

## Overview

City-like visualization for UML diagrams by combining MetaView (relationships across reduced-size UML views) and MetricView (metrics overlaid as height/color/shape). CC015 reports a user study showing improved speed and correctness versus conventional 2D UML diagrams.

## CC015 Table 1

- **Language**: UML
- **VR**: n/a
- **Building**: class / various
- **Source code**: n/a
- **Static**: various metrics, author
- **Dynamic**: n/a
- **Instrumentation**: n/a

## Evidence (from CC015)

CC015 reports a user study of 100 M.S. students showing improved speed and correctness when using the 3D visualization.
