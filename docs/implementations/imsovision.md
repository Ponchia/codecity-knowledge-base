# Imsovision

## Overview

Imsovision (IMmersive SOftware VISualizatION) is an early research prototype for visualizing software systems inside an immersive VR environment. CC057 describes VRML-authored visualizations rendered in the CAVE, using stereoscopic projection and wand-based interaction for navigation and exploration.

## Notable Details (from CC057)

- **Target environment**: CAVE (room-sized stereoscopic projection) rather than a head-mounted display.
- **Interaction**: tracked shutter glasses + a wand (buttons + joystick) for 3D interaction and navigation beyond the physical room size.
- **Visualization example**: maps a small UML-modeled system into a 3D scene that also exposes size/structure cues beyond the 2D class diagram.
- **Collaboration direction**: discusses collaborative software visualization and motivates “Multiple Collaborative Representations” (MCR) as a guiding concept.
