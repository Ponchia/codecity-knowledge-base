# Vulnerability Overlay (SAST in City)

## Definition

An overlay that maps static application security testing (SAST) findings onto the city, coloring method floors (or parts of buildings) by vulnerability severity and highlighting them for exploration.

## Mechanism (from CC069)

**Input**: SAST results (SpotBugs/FindSecBugs XML with per-method findings and severities) plus package/class/method structure.

**Process**:
1. Represent classes as buildings and methods as internal floors.
2. For each vulnerable method, widen the corresponding floor and assign a color by severity (red=high, orange=medium, green=low, blue=info).
3. Optionally render dependency packages in a neutral color (magenta) to separate first-party vs third-party code ownership.
4. Let users toggle call-graph links so related vulnerable methods are highlighted together.

**Output**: A city where vulnerable methods stand out as colored bands within buildings, with optional call-graph arcs to show propagation paths.

## Variations

| Implementation | Encoding | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| SecCityVR | Color + widened floors; severity palette from SpotBugs priorities | Methods default hidden until needed; dependency districts tinted magenta. |
