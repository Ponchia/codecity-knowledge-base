# Vulnerability Overlay (SAST in City)

## Problem & Motivation

This capability helps connect analysis findings to structural and spatial context so they are explainable and actionable. An overlay that maps static application security testing (SAST) findings onto the city, coloring method floors (or parts of buildings) by vulnerability severity and highlighting them for exploration. Without it, findings stay detached from structure, making prioritization and communication harder.

## Definition

An overlay that maps static application security testing (SAST) findings onto the city, coloring method floors (or parts of buildings) by vulnerability severity and highlighting them for exploration.

## Mechanism (Solution)

**Input**: SAST results (SpotBugs/FindSecBugs XML with per-method findings and severities) plus package/class/method structure.

**Process**:
1. Represent classes as buildings and methods as internal floors.
2. For each vulnerable method, widen the corresponding floor and assign a color by severity (red=high, orange=medium, green=low, blue=info).
3. Optionally render dependency packages in a neutral color (magenta) to separate first-party vs third-party code ownership.
4. Let users toggle call-graph links so related vulnerable methods are highlighted together.

**Output**: A city where vulnerable methods stand out as colored bands within buildings, with optional call-graph arcs to show propagation paths.

## Consequences & Trade-offs

| ✅ Benefits | ❌ Liabilities |
|-------------|----------------|
| Surfaces quality/evolution signals in context. | Overlays can overwhelm the base metaphor. |
| Supports prioritization (hotspots, anomalies). | Signals may be noisy or metric-dependent. |

## Variations

| Implementation | Encoding | Notes |
|----------------|----------|-------|
| SecCityVR | Color + widened floors; severity palette from SpotBugs priorities | Methods default hidden until needed; dependency districts tinted magenta. |
