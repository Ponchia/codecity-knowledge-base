## Overview

This survey provides a meticulous exploration of the VR landscape, delineating between commercial solutions and bespoke systems crafted for research-specific needs, with focus on eye-tracking technology integration.

## Key Themes

### Evolution of VR + Eye Tracking
Virtual reality has evolved substantially beyond gaming and entertainment. Eye-tracking stands out as a pivotal development that:
- Augments immersion
- Offers nuanced insight into user behavior and attention
- Provides precision in capturing gaze direction

### Applications
Eye-tracking in VR is instrumental for:
- Medical diagnostics
- Neuroscientific research
- Educational interventions
- Architectural design
- Software comprehension (relevant to code cities)
