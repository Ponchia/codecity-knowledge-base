# CC160: WebGL to WebGPU Migration/Performance

**Source URL**: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3730567.3764504
**Year**: 2025
**Gap Category**: Performance/Rendering

## Overview

This source addresses the transition from WebGL to WebGPU and associated performance improvements for web-based 3D graphics.

## Relevance to Software City Visualization

### Performance Benefits
- Modern GPU API designed for web browsers
- Better performance for complex 3D scenes
- Improved support for compute shaders
- More efficient rendering pipelines

### Application to Code Cities
- Enables larger codebases to be visualized
- Smoother navigation in complex city scenes
- Better support for real-time updates
- Enables LOD (Level of Detail) implementations

## Technical Context

WebGPU represents the next generation of web graphics APIs, succeeding WebGL with:
- Lower CPU overhead
- Explicit GPU resource management
- Compute shader support
- Better multi-threading support

## Relevance to CodeCity Knowledge Base
- **Primary**: Foundation for "WebGPU rendering backend" feature
- **Bounded Context**: universal
- **Feature Category**: platform
- **Gap Filled**: Performance optimization for web-based implementations
- **Related Implementations**: SoftVis3D, BabiaXR, JSCity could benefit
