## Abstract

The paper presents a hybrid system combining deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided visual exploration. The authors note that "understanding large-scale, complex software systems is a major challenge" and propose integrating AI with structured visualization.

## Key Contributions

### Core Approach
A hybrid system combining deterministic reverse engineering with LLM-guided visual exploration for understanding large-scale software systems.

### Technical Components
- **UML-based visualization** for structural representation
- **Dynamic user interfaces** adapted to user intent
- **Historical context** tracking for navigation
- **Collaborative features** for team workflows
- **LLM integration** for interpreting user queries and interaction patterns

### Software City Applicability
Relevant techniques for software city visualization include:
1. **Intent-aware navigation** - LLMs interpret developer queries to guide exploration
2. **Contextual grounding** - Combining AI capabilities with deterministic structural views
3. **Interactive adaptation** - System responds to user interaction patterns to improve comprehension

## Implementation & Future Work
A Java prototype demonstrates feasibility. The authors identify future directions as empirical evaluation, support for polyglot systems, and GUI-driven LLM interaction models.

## Research Scope
The work addresses Software Engineering (cs.SE), Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI), and Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC), positioning intelligent code exploration as aligned with developer cognition and workflows.

## Relevance to CodeCity Knowledge Base
- **Primary**: New feature candidate for "AI-guided navigation" or "LLM-assisted exploration"
- **Bounded Context**: universal (applicable to any software city implementation)
- **Feature Category**: interaction/analysis
